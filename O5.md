We are given the inbox link again in order to look through it. We need to find something related to an OTP. After looking at the Junk folder, we find an email titled “Your CyberGuardianPro OTP Code”. It says that the OTP was sent to XXX-XXX-4121.
But we were also given a zip file with the algorithm used to generate the OTPs. After looking through the various files, we find the generate_token() method that uses the getTimestamp() method to generate the codes. To generate the codes, the method gets the timestamp as yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm a then removes dashes, colons and spaces then takes the 6th to 12th characters as the code. From the email we can see that the OTP was received on 05/24/24 at 12:23.45. Putting it in the right format and removing spaces, dashes and colons, we get: 20240524122345. Finally we take the 6th through 12th characters and we get the OTP: 241223.
