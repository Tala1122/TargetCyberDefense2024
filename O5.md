O5. Take Over an EDR Account\
300 points\
Now that you know the EDR tool in use, you've discovered that the best way to take over assets inside of The Lucky Lion is to gain access to the console of the EDR tool. Given the high-privileged rights that EDR Services run as, getting access to this tool should provide unfettered access to The Lucky Lion's resources!\
After taking over the email account utilizing their quished credentials, you learned that the administrator is using a different password for accessing the EDR console. (Yay!) However, you've discovered the Java application that The Lucky Lion is utilizing for OTP and you've zipped it up as Alg_Gen.zip (attached in Files). After dissecting the application, it seems to be a promising (albeit disheartening) path!\
To get into the EDR console, you'll need to figure out how to take over the credentials for The Lucky Lion's EDR administrator. How can we go about obtaining the credentials for this user?\
**Objectives**\
Provide the One-Time Password from the vendor to reset the user's password.\
**Required Tools**
[Alg-gen.zip](https://github.com/Tala1122/TargetCyberDefense2024/blob/main/O5.alg_gen.zip)\
Flag Format 6 digit number Example: 123456\
**Walkthrough**\
We are given the inbox link again in order to look through it. We need to find something related to an OTP. After looking at the Junk folder, we find an email titled “Your CyberGuardianPro OTP Code”. It says that the OTP was sent to XXX-XXX-4121.
But we were also given a zip file with the algorithm used to generate the OTPs. After looking through the various files, we find the generate_token() method that uses the getTimestamp() method to generate the codes. To generate the codes, the method gets the timestamp as yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm a then removes dashes, colons and spaces then takes the 6th to 12th characters as the code. From the email we can see that the OTP was received on 05/24/24 at 12:23.45. Putting it in the right format and removing spaces, dashes and colons, we get: 20240524122345. Finally we take the 6th through 12th characters and we get the OTP: 241223.
