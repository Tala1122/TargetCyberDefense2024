D4. Write IOC detection\
100 points\
Now that we have the threat actor's cred harvesting site (wood-chewers.trees), let's write a detection rule using Suricata to alert on HTTP traffic going out from The Lucky Lion's network to the domain.
Given the Suricata rule below, can you fill in the missing information to complete the rule?
alert http $CORP_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"Detected traffic to wood-chewers.trees"; http.host; _____________; sid:1000001; rev:1;)\
**Objectives**\
Enter the missing information to complete the Suricata rule.\
**Tools required**\

Suricata rules use the content filed to specifiy what values to look for and match on. In the example given http.host was used. This keyword is then followed by the content filed. Following the example, we would need to write: content: "wood-chewers.trees" in the blank space of the rule provided.\
*Flag* content:"wood-chewers.trees"
