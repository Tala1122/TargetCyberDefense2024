O4. Use your Captured Creds\
100 points\
You cast your phishing line and within no time came up with a catch - hook, line, and sinker! Your victim submitted their Lucky Lion username and password to your credential harvester (you had to supress an eyeroll when you saw their password was "Summer24!") - now what?\
Let's see what these creds can do for us! You remember seeing a webmail portal for The Lucky Lion, and sure enough, your phished creds get you access to the employee's email account. Time to poke around to see what else we can learn about The Lucky Lion's environment.\
You intentionally targeted an employee on The Lucky Lion's information security team with your phish, knowing that they will likely have the most interesting access and information. In particular, you want to know more about The Lucky Lion's security tools so that you can be prepared to bypass them once inside their network. You expect that at a minimum, the Lucky Lion will have an Endpoint Detection and Response tool (EDR) that could give you trouble down the road.\
Let's try to determine the EDR tool utilized by The Lucky Lion. We can use our stolen credentials to sign into our victim's webmail account - utilize the link below to access the smished webmail inbox.\
**Objectives**\
Determine the name of the EDR tool utilized by The Lucky Lion.\
**Walkthrough**\
We get the url for the inbox that we need to look through: https://target-httpd.chals.io/webmail/webmail-inbox.html 				
After reading all the emails present in the user’s inbox, we find the name of two EDR tools mentioned “FortressPro” and “CyberGuardianPro”. We find an email in the Favorites folder titled: “Your Updated License File is Here!”, the last line looks like this: {CyberGuardianPro}. This is the flag!
