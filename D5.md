D5.1. Identify compromised user\
25 points\
0/10 attempts\
Now that we have detection in place for the threat actor's credential harvesting site, we can review the alerting logs in an attempt to identify any compromised users.
The attached .json file is an output from our Suricata rule.
Review our detection logs to identify network traffic to the cred harvester. Using these logs, we need to identify users who may have been compromised, and then identify the specific user and host we should start analyzing first. To start, we should figure out how many users in total we need to look into.\
**Objectives**\
Based on our logs, how many users or hosts does it appear had traffic to the credential harvesting site were there? Enter response as an integer.\
**Tools**\

D5.2. Identify compromised user\
75 points\
Alright, we have a good idea of how many users visited the known malicious site, but we should also try to see whether these users actually submitted credentials to the harvester, so let's take a closer look at our Suricata alert logs.
Reviewing the traffic, what field and value indicates that credentials may have been sent to the malicious site?
**Objectives**\
Enter the field name that indicates a user credentials may have been sent to the malicious site and its value, exactly as in the log (i.e. "field_name": "value")\
D5.3. Identify compromised user\
20 points\
Let's take one final look at our alert logs. We've now identified the HTTP_method indicating credentials were sent to the phishing domain.\
**Objectives**\
What is the IP address that was responsible for that traffic?\
D5.4 Identify compromised user\
50 points\
We have the IP address that we believe is responsible for submitting credentials to the threat actor's domain. Now, our networking team has provided us with some logs that will let us find the hosts and users associated with the traffic.
Given that in The Lucky Lion's environment, the logs are relatively small, it's easy to correlate our source.ip to the user and PC we want to look at.
If we recall our src_ip from the Suricata alert with the POST HTTP traffic to the phishing domain (10.15.38.78) , we see that our user and host are: host: WDIGCVY2S, user: bob_wctf24
However, in a larger incident, you may have to search through tens of thousands or more records. Let's see how we might enumerate logs in that case\
**Objectives**\
Can you write a simple query using bash that would quickly let you search for data associated with the IP we've identified? Submit that command as the flag. -Assume you are in the same directory as the file you are searching.\
**Tools**\

**Walkthrough for all 4 challenges**\
The provided JSON file contained eight alerts for traffic to domain wood-chewers.trees. Each event has a unique src_ip value, which means that there are 8 people who visited the site. In order to find out who submitted their credentials, we need to see who had a POST request because that would mean that data was sent to the domain. Everyone had GET or CONNECT requests except for one user that had a POST request which means he is the one that submitted his credentials to the site. This user has a source ip of 10.15.38.78 which we can see from the logs. In order to find this event in the network logs provided we can use the command: grep 10.15.38.78 networklogs.csv\
*Flag 5.1* 8\
*Flag 5.2* "http-method":"POST"\
*Flag 5.3* 10.15.38.78\
*Flag 5.4* grep '10.15.38.78' networklogs.csv
