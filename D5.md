Identify compromised user\
**Objective**\
Find out how many people visited the malicious site and who submitted their credentials.\
**Walkthrough**\
The provided JSON file contained eight alerts for traffic to domain wood-chewers.trees. Each event has a unique src_ip value, which means that there are 8 people who visited the site. In order to find out who submitted their credentials, we need to see who had a POST request because that would mean that data was sent to the domain. Everyone had GET or CONNECT requests except for one user that had a POST request which means he is the one that submitted his credentials to the site.
