D8. YARA Analysis\
500 points\
You and the rest of The Lucky Lion's IR team are deep in your investigation, digging into hosts with signs of unusual activity. While pulling artifacts from host A (WDIGCVY2S), you identified the tool download utilized by the threat actor. You capture the file and submit it to Strelka, a real-time, container-based file scanning system used for threat hunting, threat detection, and incident response. The strelka.json results identified the file as AnyDesk and you determined the file was downloaded and utilized by the threat actor.\
**Objectives**\
Create a YARA rule that will detect the target file. The target file has similar meta information identified in strelka.json. There are a total of 100 files, only one is the target file.\
Flag Format Typical CTF flag th4t_l00kz_l1k3_th1s\
**Tools Required**\
Command to Run: curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" https://target-flask.chals.io/api/v1/yara-scan -X POST -d 'rule test {condition: true}'\
[Strelka file](https://github.com/Tala1122/TargetCyberDefense2024/blob/main/strelka.json)\
**Walkthrough**\
We are given the command curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" https://target- flask.chals.io/api/v1/yara-scan -X POST -d 'rule test {condition: true}' and a file strelka.json. If we run the command, the response is {"target_file":true,"total_matches":"100/100"}.
So we need to build a more specific YARA rule that will only detect the target file. We can look at the json file for information. We can start with a header byte check to only detect EXE files. So we add:\
rule test{condition: uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a}\
Running this, we still get 100 matches. We move on to something else. The scan results indicate that the file is a 32bit PE. We can add this to the rule:\
import "pe" rule test{condition:uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and pe.is_32bit()}\
Still a 100 matches. From the scan we can also see pdb path in the debug information.\
import "pe" rule test{condition:uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and pe.is_32bit() and pe.pdb_path == "C:\\Buildbot\\ad-windows-32\\build\\release\\app-32\\win_loader\\AnyDesk.pdb"}\
We still have a 100 matches! Other characteristics we can try to look for are compile timestamps.\
import "pe" rule test{condition: uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and pe.is_32bit() and pe.pdb_path == "C:\\Buildbot\\ad-windows-32\\build\\release\\app-32\\win_loader\\AnyDesk.pdb" and pe.timestamp == 1713963204}\
6 matches!! We are getting somewhere. We can add the checksum, since each file is supposed to have a unique checksum, it can surely help.\
import "pe" rule test{condition: uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and pe.is_32bit() and pe.pdb_path == "C:\\Buildbot\\ad-windows-32\\build\\release\\app-32\\win_loader\\AnyDesk.pdb" and pe.timestamp == 1713963204 and pe.checksum == 5359632}\
3 matches!! Let's try to clean it up a bit by removing the unnecessary checks that didn't filter the search down.\
import "pe" rule test{condition: uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and pe.timestamp == 1713963204 and pe.checksum == 5359632}\
Success!!!!
We have the flag.
