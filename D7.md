D7.1. Review Connection Logs (Host A)\
50 points\
We have identified our host and user in The Lucky Lion's environment that may have been accessed by a malicious actor. In the previous challenge, we identified AnyDesk was downloaded via PCAP analysis on our suspect host. Let's perform some artifact analysis from that host in order to see what the threat actor may have done with AnyDesk.
Let's look at our compromised user's (bob_wctf24) Windows host WDIGCVY2S. AnyDesk can be used to remotely connect to a host, drop payloads, and steal files, but it should leave traces we can use in our investigation.
Can you use your security research skills and find out where the logs for AnyDesk are located?\
**Objectives**\
Locate the artifacts we need to assess suspicious activity on our host by finding the full path (beginning with C:) to the directory where AnyDesk's logs would be on our host.\
D7.2. Review Connection Logs (Host A)\
50 points\
Now that we have identified where the logs are, let's take a look at one of the files and see what we can learn about our threat actor.
Based on our OSINT research in the previous flag, can we identify which fields in the attached ad_scv.trace log identify our attacker?\
**Objectives**\
Review host artifacts to identify who and when our victim's PC was accessed. Answer both of the following questions to create the flag:
- What is the exact timestamp when the connection was opened?
- What is the the IP address of the remote host connecting to Bob's computer?
- Submit your answer comma separated so that it matches the following format: YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00.000,IP.IP.IP.IP\

**Walkthrough for both challenges**\
By Googling "anydesk logs location" we can see a few options, one of which is C:\Users\%Username%\Appdata\Roaming\AnyDesk. By filling in the fields using the info from the host we get: C:\Users\bob_wctf24\AppData\Roaming\AnyDesk.\
Opening the provided file shows 8 items logged. The log for ‘New ANY connection’ shows that the connection was established at 2024-04-18 06:42:31.190. Within the logs there is only one IP address (203.0.161.68) and it is also listed as having logged in.\
*Flag 7.1* C:\Users\bob_wctf24\AppData\Roaming\AnyDesk.\
*Flag 7.2* 2024-04-18 06:42:31.190,203.0.161.68
