O2. Build a Credential Harvester\
100 points\
Now that you have targets in hand, it's time to craft your attack. You'll need some way to harvest your victims' credentials, and sometimes the most straightforward approach is the best one - how about a credential harvester?\
You're more likely to trick The Lucky Lion's employees if your harvester looks realistic - best to start with finding their real employee sign-in page and see if you can mimic it. Maybe start by looking at the Lucky Lion home page you found while looking for phishing targets?\
**Objective**\
Clone the sign-up page & host on different domain to build a credential harvester. Once you do, submit the credentials "admin" and "password" to receive the flag.\
**Tools Required**\
Web Browser\
Any Website Cloning Tool like HTTrack or goclone\
Static Server Utility like serve or nginx\
**Walkthrough**\
First we can go to the casino homepage: https://target-httpd.chals.io/casion/homepage.html. There we can find a login button which takes us to the login page: https://target-httpd.chals.io/casion/employee-login.html. This is the page we will have to clone. It needs to be very similar for a higher chance of success at phishing the employees.
We can then run goclone https://target-httpd.chals.io/casion/employee-login.html in Terminal.
This create a folder “target-httpd.chals.io/” with the cloned file. To access it via browser, we can host it locally using static server utility like serve (for CTF purposes). We then cd into our cloned files and run serve in Terminal. By opening http://localhost:3000 in the browser, we can see the login page. We try to login with admin & password. The flag appears right below the login button!
