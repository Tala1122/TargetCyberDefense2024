Build a Credential Harvester\
**Objectives**\
Build credential harvester i.e clone of legitimate website to social engineer employees from casino\
**Walkthrough**\
First we can go to the casino homepage: https://target-httpd.chals.io/casion/homepage.html. There we can find a login button which takes us to the login page: https://target-httpd.chals.io/casion/employee-login.html. This is the page we will have to clone. It needs to be very similar for a higher chance of success at phishing the employees.
We can then run goclone https://target-httpd.chals.io/casion/employee-login.html in Terminal.
This create a folder “target-httpd.chals.io/” with the cloned file. To access it via browser, we can host it locally using static server utility like serve (for CTF purposes). We then cd into our cloned files and run serve in Terminal. By opening http://localhost:3000 in the browser, we can see the login page. We try to login with admin & password. The flag appears right below the login button!
