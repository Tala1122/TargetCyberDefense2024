PCAP Analysis\
**Objective**\
Examine a PCAP file of Bob's browsing traffic to determine which tool was downloaded on the host and where it came from.\
**Walkthrough**\
Opening the PCAP file with Wireshark, we can filter the traffic by "http". After that we are left with only 4 packets. Packet 23 is the request for the Remote Access tool. By clicking on the packet, we can see the full request URI: http://anydesk.com:8000/AnyDesk.exe
