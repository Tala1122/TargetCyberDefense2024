Investigate a suspicious Email\
**Objective**\
Find the flag hidden in a user's email\
**Walkthrough**\
Looking through the email, the only suspicious thing that is noticed is that the QR code doesn't redirect to a url but rather jumbled text. Uploading the QR code to CyberChef, we can click Decode QR and obtain the ciphertext. There could be a number of things that are potentially in play. However, the easiest first thing to try is a rotation cipher. This technique is done by rotating the alphabet a certain number of times. Trying various number of rotations in CyberChef, we finally get our flag by trying ROT13.
