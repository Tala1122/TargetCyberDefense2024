D3. Investigate a Suspicious Email\
25 points\
While you're keeping an eye on incoming alerts, you notice an email pop into The Lucky Lion's security inbox from a concerned employee. They report receiving an unexpected email asking them to verify their identity.
There might be hidden evidence of tampering in this email, since on the surface it looks legitimate. Can you figure out where the attacker might have left a calling card?\
**Objectives**\
Find the evidence of attacker tampering (will have the format flag{.........})\

**Walkthrough**\
Looking through the email, the only suspicious thing that is noticed is that the QR code doesn't redirect to a url but rather jumbled text. Uploading the QR code to CyberChef, we can click Decode QR and obtain the ciphertext. There could be a number of things that are potentially in play. However, the easiest first thing to try is a rotation cipher. This technique is done by rotating the alphabet a certain number of times. Trying various number of rotations in CyberChef, we finally get our flag by trying ROT13.\
