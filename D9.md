Review Connection Logs (Host B)\
**Objective**\
Find the path that the attacker uploaded to.\
**Walkthrough**\
We can see "preparing files in C:\path\to\files" which means that those are the files to be SENT to our victim. The Ad.trace file lists the Preparing files in path as C:\Users\TimmyTermite\Desktop\fun_files. The user.conf file list shows the same remote file path in the ad.session.remote_browser_start_path field. The ad_svc.trace file contains the connection information. This log shows the connection going to 10.15.38.42:57836 with 57836 representing the port number.\
The path that the Threat Actor uploaded to is listed in the user.conf file. It is the file path in the ad.session.local_browser_start_path field: C:\Users\wctf24\AppData\Local\Temp
