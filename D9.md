D9.1. Review Connection Logs (Host B)\
75 points\
Thanks to the Yara rule you developed, we received an alert detecting the AnyDesk hash on another host. Let's take a look at the logs to see if we can get an idea of what more the threat actor did on this host.\
Once again, let's try to OSINT our way into deciphering these AnyDesk logs.\
**Objectives**\
Analyze a second host's connection logs for further indicators of compromise by answering the following questions to construct your flag:\
Given these AnyDesk log files, can you determine whether the threat actor uploaded to or downloaded from our internal host?\
What is the directory name of the folder on the threat actor's machine?\
What is the port number over which our internal host has accepted the connection?\
D9.2. Review Connection Logs (Host B)\
50 points\
Thanks to the Yara rule you developed, we received an alert detecting the AnyDesk hash on another host. Let's take a look at the logs to see if we can get an idea of what more the threat actor did on this host.\
**Objectives**\
Determine the name of the directory that the threat actor successfully dropped a file into on our victim host. Enter as normalized path beginning with "C:"\
**Tools**\
[Ad_svc.trace](https://github.com/Tala1122/TargetCyberDefense2024/blob/main/D.9.ad_svc.trace)\
[User.conf](https://github.com/Tala1122/TargetCyberDefense2024/blob/main/D.9user.conf)\
[Ad.trace](https://github.com/Tala1122/TargetCyberDefense2024/blob/main/D9.Ad.trace)\
**Walkthrough**\
We can see "preparing files in C:\path\to\files" which means that those are the files to be SENT to our victim. The Ad.trace file lists the Preparing files in path as C:\Users\TimmyTermite\Desktop\fun_files. The user.conf file list shows the same remote file path in the ad.session.remote_browser_start_path field. The ad_svc.trace file contains the connection information. This log shows the connection going to 10.15.38.42:57836 with 57836 representing the port number.\
The path that the Threat Actor uploaded to is listed in the user.conf file. It is the file path in the ad.session.local_browser_start_path field: C:\Users\wctf24\AppData\Local\Temp
