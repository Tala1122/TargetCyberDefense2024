O3. Constructing your Phish\
100 points\
You have your credential harvester ready to go, but how exactly are you going to trick your victims into visiting the site hosting it? Much like the harvester, your "hook" will work best if it mimicks something legitimate that the victim is expecting to see.\
While researching The Lucky Lion leading in preparation for this attack, you had discovered that the casino uses multi-factor authentication for employees. Specifically, you learned that they use Squishy Security, a budget security solution notorious for a host of backdoors. Employees need to scan a QR code to sign up with the service on their company phones, so perhaps we can phish them to click on our harvester? Given this [MFA onboarding email](https://github.com/Tala1122/TargetCyberDefense2024/blob/main/O3.email.png), can you engineer an attack QR code to capitalize on Squishy Security's lackluster control mechanisms?\
**Objectives**\
Crack the MFA QR code's security scheme
Submit your own malicious QR code that is the same as the example, except it would redirect to http://wood-chewers.trees instead of the normal casino sign-in. NOTE: if the example QR's text had any special formatting/encryption applied, so should your submitted QR!\
**Walkthrough**\
While looking at the email, when we scan the QR code, we get this: XVFQZkFVUUBVQwsZc312c3N0eH5zBHBzfXZwaXNxd2NndHB7c3EPDw0KDAQ4QldWWUVUWkZvR0BcDRFRRkRCCB8YVEFTXUJeVRlSVl8=
There are also other hints in the email. The email says that there is an mfa_secret inside the QR code and it also says that the company Xpert Online Resilience has created a “foolproof cipher”. If we examine the name closely we can see that the initials spell XOR. 
We can clearly see that the QR code is base64 encoded, using CyberChef we can decoded and we obtain ]QPfAUQ@UC��s}vsstx~s�ps}vpisqwcgtp{sq���8BWVYETZFoG@\�QFDB���TAS]B^U�RV_
Then we can use the info we gained from the email and XOR the text with our known plaintext (mfa_secret) according to the following property of XOR:\
IF plaintext XOR key = ciphertext THEN plaintext XOR ciphertext = key\
The beginning is the only readable part and it looks like a repeating date, it is also the same date in the footer of the email.\
We can now construct our QR code by reversing the CyberChef process!
1. We XOR http://wood-chewers.trees with the plaintext 07192022.
2. We then Base64 encode the output.
3. And finally QR encode the output.
