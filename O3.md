Constructing your phish\
**Objectives**\
Crack the MFA QR code’s security scheme and build your own malicious QR code that redirects to http://wood-chewers.trees instead of the casino sign-in.\
**Walkthrough**\
While looking at the email, when we scan the QR code, we get this: XVFQZkFVUUBVQwsZc312c3N0eH5zBHBzfXZwaXNxd2NndHB7c3EPDw0KDAQ4QldWWUVUWkZvR0BcDRFRRkRCCB8YVEFTXUJeVRlSVl8=
There are also other hints in the email. The email says that there is an mfa_secret inside the QR code and it also says that the company Xpert Online Resilience has created a “foolproof cipher”. If we examine the name closely we can see that the initials spell XOR. 
We can clearly see that the QR code is base64 encoded, using CyberChef we can decoded and we obtain ]QPfAUQ@UC��s}vsstx~s�ps}vpisqwcgtp{sq���8BWVYETZFoG@\�QFDB���TAS]B^U�RV_
Then we can use the info we gained from the email and XOR the text with our known plaintext (mfa_secret) according to the following property of XOR:\
IF plaintext XOR key = ciphertext THEN plaintext XOR ciphertext = key\
The beginning is the only readable part and it looks like a repeating date, it is also the same date in the footer of the email.\
We can now construct our QR code by reversing the CyberChef process!
1. We XOR http://wood-chewers.trees with the plaintext 07192022.
2. We then Base64 encode the output.
3. And finally QR encode the output.
