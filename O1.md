O1. Find your Targets\
100 points\
Crack your knuckles and wiggle your fingers - it's time to hack a casino! First things first - you need an entry point. Phishing is a tried and true method and somewhat of a specialty to Tacky Termite, why not start there?\
The first step of a well-crafted social engineering campaign is to rustle up some targets - specifically a corporate email. Thankfully the casino has a website chock full of information to get us started. From there, use open source intelligence (OSINT) to find a usable email address.\
**Objectives**\
Find the email address of a Lucky Lion employee, there should be a flag nearby!\
**Tools**\

**Walkthrough**\
The challenge gives you the Lucky Lion website to start there. Looking at the website we can see that there is “The Team” page that has information about the employees. Each employee has a twitter handle listed except for Alex Lee. We can then go to twitter and find the employees to check their posts, followers as well as who they’re following. While looking at the profiles of the employees there isn’t much to find however we see that Camilla G seems to be following more accounts than her coworkers. Looking at the list, we see someone named CrypticGuardian at @alexlee387728 which seems to be the account of the missing employee. This personal account has a github page linked. Clicking on the github link, we can see that the user works at the Lucky Lion casino and we can find their corporate email address and the flag listed!
