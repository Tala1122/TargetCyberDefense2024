D1. Secure Your Perimeter\

0/5 attempts\
After receiving a tip from a peer organization's Cyber Threat Intelligence team that prolific threat actor group Tacky Termite recently posted that they're gearing up to cyber-heist a casino, you've been tasked with making sure The Lucky Lion Casino is secured against any such cyber attacks.
As if it were that simple! You know it's impossible for any company to be fully protected against attacks, but you can certainly make it more difficult for any would-be attacker.
Let's start by eliminating any easy entry points by scanning The Lucky Lion's network for vulnerabilities. After running your vulnerability scanning tool Centauros, you now have a very long list of potential security issues impacting hosts in your environment.
It would definitely be best to remediate ALL of these issues, but who knows how much time you have before an attacker also discovers the vulnerabilities? You will need to prioritize the most critical issues first - take a look at the list and identify the CVE of the vulnerability that would be most prudent to remediate quickly.\
**Objectives**\
Identify the most critical vulnerability that should be remediated first.\

**Walkthrough**\
Taking a look at the network diagram, we see that there are 4 hosts in the DMZ. Looking at the list of vulnerabilities, only one of them appears there (ar276joiu). Through all of the vulnerabilities of this host, one of them has a severity of Critical. That is the one that we need to solve the challenge!\
*Flag* CVE-2024-29994
