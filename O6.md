O6. Find a Way In\

Now that you have some credentials, let's find somewhere to use them!\
You fire up Nmap, your trusty network mapper, and configure a scan to identify hosts in The Lucky Lion's IP space that are online and reachable.\
You've found one server in particular that looks like a potentially juicy target, but to know for sure whether the host will have something you can sign into with your stolen credentials, you'll need to know what services are open. Use Nmap to scan this server to determine which services specifically are available.\
**Objectives**\
Determine the name of the services running on the server of interest\
**Walkthrough**\
Run the command nmap -p12557 -sV -Pn 0.cloud.chals.io\
This will return a scan with the banner for a service it doesn't recognize. Inside it are the name and version of the webapp and the flag.
